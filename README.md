# Canvas site template
A basic template for a site made entirely of canvas.
## Getting set up
First clone the repository, move into it's directory and run
```
npm install
npm start
```
This will install all dependencies and start the development server. From here you can make changes to the server and frontend code and the app will automatically rebuild itself. You will just need to refresh the tab with the localhost open.
